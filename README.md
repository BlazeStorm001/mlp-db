# Visualization and Comparison of Decision Boundaries: Logistic Regression vs Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Implemented from Scratch on the Iris Dataset
The project focuses on comparing the decision boundaries of Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron models fit on the Iris Dataset. The Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron are implemented from scratch using numpy.
